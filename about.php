				<p><i>La ristorante Italiano opened September 8, 2005 initially to
				showcase the sausages and processed meats produced by the Swiss Deli
				and already being supplied to various Restaurants Supermarket and
				Hotels nationwide. The Idea of adding imported deli items came about
				since there was yet no Delicatessen in the City catering mainly to the expatriate and upper market.</i></p>
